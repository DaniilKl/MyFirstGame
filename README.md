# My first game.
<p> Memories... It was my first project in C++.</p>
<p> It is based on statically linked graphical library "SFML" with some constituents from Windows API (I was experimenting with threads, the experiment did pay off cos after it I dove in books about Operating Systems, and, eventually embedded programming). It may look pretty simple and a bit rough, but I am proud of myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/l1SuiAgBt_Y" target="_blank">Here</a> how it looks like after compilation. </p>
